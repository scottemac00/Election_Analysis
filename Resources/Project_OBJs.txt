In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

    Total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    Total number of votes each candidate received
    Percentage of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote

1. Open the data file
2. List the names of candidates 
3. Add a vote count for each candidate
4. Get the total votes for each candidate
5. Get the total votes cast for the election
6. Calculate the percentage of votes won by each candidate
7. Calculate the winner of the election based on popular vote (most votes received)

# Add dependencies
import csv
import os

# Assign a variable to load a file from a path
file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")
# Assign a variable to save the file to a path
file_to_save = os.path.join("Analysis", "election_analysis.txt")

# Open the election results and read the file
with open(file_to_load) as election_data:

    # Read the file object with the reader function
    file_reader = csv.reader(election_data)

    # Print each row in the CSV file
    for row in file_reader:
        print(row)

    # The data we need to retrieve.
    # 1. Get the list of names of the candidates
    # 2. Add a vote count for each candidate
    # 3. Get the total votes for each candidate
    # 4. Get the total votes cast for the election
    # 5. Calculate the percentage of votes won by each candidate
    # 6. Calculate the winner of the election based on popular vote
    #print the file object
    print(election_data)


# Using the with statement open the file as a text file
with open (file_to_save, "w") as txt_file:
# Write three counties to the file
    txt_file.write("Counties in the Election\n")
    txt_file.write("-------------------------\n")
    txt_file.write("Arapahoe\nDenver\nJefferson")
