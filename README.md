# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

    1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
    2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
    3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
    4. Calculate the percentage of votes won by each candidate.
    5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
Data was sourced from the following file and with the following software:
- election_results.csv retrieved from UCF Canvas on 10/21/2022
- Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code 1.72.2 

## Summary
Analysis of the election results shows that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast.
- The Candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The Results are as follows:
  - Charlese Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes.
  - **Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.**
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.  
  - As noted in **BOLD** above, Diana DeGette won the popular vote.
  
  ## Challenge Overview
  This challenge included an exploration of and experiential practice with Python software, GitHub, MS Excel, Visual Studio Code, Notepad, and Git Bash. Critical to the success of the challenge was iterating with the code to produce the required scripts that told the programs where to look, for what data, and what to do with it.
  
  ## Challenge Summary
  The most influential aspect of this challenge (for me) was the attention to detail in tabbing the code in Visual Studio Code. I appreciate the program quickly highlighting errors or incorrect expectations for me to rectify.
